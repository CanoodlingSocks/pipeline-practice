# Pipeline practice

This is a simple React app with an empty page and two `<h>` tags, whereas one says "Update this text" 
It's designed as a practice repo to experiment with setting up a deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Deployment Pipeline

I've set up a deployment pipeline that automatically triggers whenever a pull request is closed. 
This pipeline will redeploy the React app and hopefully the h-tag will now say something like "Text is updated".
